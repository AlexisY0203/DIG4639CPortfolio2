This is an exercise app allowing users many features that would be helpful in training. On the homepage there are 4 steps (Warm Up Exercises, Random Exercises, Exercise Quiz, To-Do List).
For the first component, there are three warm up exercises listed (Situps, Pushups, and Squats) where the user can select on of the buttons. This takes them to a screen with the exercise name, description, a counter to follow their reps, another button to a suggested exercise, and finally a button back to the homepage.
Next is a button for users to find a random exercise to be presented to them.
After this is an exercise quiz to see what exercise types they should be doing based on their main goals.
Finally is a button where experienced gym goers can create their own to do list. They can add their own exercises to this list and check them off as completed.
